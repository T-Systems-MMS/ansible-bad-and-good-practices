## Contributing

If you want to contribute you can create a merge request so other colleagues will discuss the code with you. Make sure to add both a good and a bad practice to your code example.

Make sure that:
- your code won't contain credentials
- you've commented the code why it is a good or bad practice
- your code can be easily run, so please add a full playbook if possible
- be open to discuss with your colleagues
